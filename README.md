# Smithsoft Site

A Gatsby transform from WordPress React-app.

## Html-React-Parser

For now this project is using [HTML React Parser](https://github.com/remarkablemark/html-react-parser).  There's a similarly named project [React HTML Parser](https://github.com/wrakky/react-html-parser) that does the same thing.

It looks as though the former one is [smaller, better at updates & issues and has more stars](https://www.npmtrends.com/html-react-parser-vs-react-html-parser-vs-react-render-html) so for now that's the one being used.
